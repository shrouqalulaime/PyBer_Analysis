# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
This project analyzes ridesharing data to understand the relationship between city type, number of rides, and drivers. This analysis would help improve ridesharing services and determine affordability for unserved neighborhoods. 

## Results:
The analysis results of ridesharing data, which include city type, ride count, driver count, and fare, showed that urban cities have the most significant number of rides and drivers, which are 1.6k and 59.6k, respectively. As a result, the total fare amount is the largest, with $39.8k, compared to $19k and $4k for sub-rural and rural cities, respectively. Because of the availability of many drivers, the average fare per ride and driver is the lowest compared to other city types. The results are summarized in the table below.

The multiple-line chart below compares the trend of average fare over a particular time, Jan to May 2019, among different city types. The figure shows that rural areas have the lowest total fare due to the limited availability of rides and driver count.

## Summary:
Based on the analysis results, increasing the number of drivers in rural areas is recommended to make riding services affordable.
